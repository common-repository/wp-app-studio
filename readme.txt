= Author's Words on the current version =

With Wp App Studio 5.3 version, we are moving more and more towards to our goal of creating a fully featured integrated development environment (IDE) for WordPress. We think the addition of a PHP field in app settings and ability to write PHP code in view layouts will help us achieve this goal. If you need to write PHP code in view layouts, just use [PHP]Code here[/PHP] format. Thanks to the CodeMirror integration, you also have an excellent code editor supporting PHP, JavaScript and HTML.

Another major improvement is the introduction of EMD templating system which, we believe, will fix the issues related to the themes with unorthodox markup. If you use EMD templating system, you need to wrap your attributes, taxonomies and relationships in "emd_is_item_visible() function in a PHP code snippet. If WPAS detects this function's usage, it auto creates customization tab in the settings. The new templating system allows users to enable, disable, or hide(from frontend only) attributes, taxonomies or relationships without modifying user's theme template files and comes with EMD Widget area which can be used to display widgets in the generated plugin's pages. WPAS ProDev owners can enable or disable this feature and switch back to theme based templating system. 

WPAS 5.3 also auto creates some tools for administrators to improve plugin performance and provides a CSS area (Tools tab of the generated plugin's settings) where you can write plugin specific code.The CSS code written in this area must be only applicable to and works in plugin pages. Check out [eMarket Design YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfjfazP0NchiEbcIw-Vec_g?view_as=public) for videos and more.

Ability to export and import entity configurations is another step forward to improve reusability of plugin data model. You can use this feature, if an entity is used in multiple apps. Instead recreating the same entity configuration and attributes, export entity metadata and import it to the new app, saving yourself some more time on development.

We also did some improvements in page load times by displaying app tags in view layouts on demand, included code to improve menu structure in the admin area and more. We hope that this change will help developers get better results in lower end computers or hosting environments. There are other additions, improvements and fixes as well. Please refer to the What's new tab under Getting Started page for the complete list.

The next WPAS version will continue improving WP App Studio plugin, the platform generated code and integrating technologies which can help us make WordPress the preferred application development platform. 

Happy Coding :-)
